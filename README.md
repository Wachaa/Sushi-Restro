## 🧠 What I Learned

This project was a great learning experience! I followed this [YouTube tutorial](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QRrPE9aj3wI&t=4689s), which helped me understand how to set up a clean, fast, and modern website using **Vite**. 

Key things I learned:

- How to create smooth scroll animations using **AOS (Animate On Scroll)**.
- Basic principles of responsive web design and UI layout.

## 🔧 Technologies Used

- **Vite**: A fast and modern build tool that made this project incredibly easy to develop.
- **HTML/CSS/JavaScript**: The core web technologies to create and style the website.
